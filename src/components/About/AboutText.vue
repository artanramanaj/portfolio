      Since beginning my journey as a freelance developer nearly 10 years ago,
      I’ve done remote work for agencies, consulted for startups, and
      collaborated with talented people to create web products for both business
      and consumer use.
    </p>
    <p>
      I create successful responsive websites that are fast, easy to use, and
      built with best practices. The main area of my expertise is front-end
      development, HTML, CSS, JS, building small and medium web apps, custom
      plugins, features, animations, and coding interactive layouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also have full-stack developer experience with popular open-source CMS
      like (WordPress, Drupal, Magento, Keystone.js and others) .
