      As a frontend/full-stack developer, I specialize in building seamless and scalable web applications. On the backend, I utilize Node.js and Express.js to develop efficient APIs, manage authentication, and work with databases like MongoDB and MySQL. By combining a strong frontend foundation with a well-structured backend, I ensure high-performance and secure applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      I take pride in my ability to collaborate effectively with
      cross-functional teams, including designers, project managers, and other 
      developers. I strive to understand their unique perspectives and
      objectives to deliver high-quality, optimized code that meets project
      goals and exceeds user expectations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Communication is key in my work, and
      I believe in maintaining transparency and open lines of communication
      throughout the development process.
